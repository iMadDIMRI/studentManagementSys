# studentManagementSys

Working on a small project to reinforce what I’ve studied in C and Git.

It won’t be finished anytime soon, as I’m adding and correcting parts everytime.

As for optimization, I’ll focus on that later—right now, my main goal is to finish the core .

Any feedback or suggestions are welcome—whether it’s about the project or things I could learn to improve my programming skills.
